# perceptron-asm

Implementation of a single-layer perceptron in x86 assembly.

I was inspired by the very simple perceptron algorithm described in [Veritasium's video on analog computers](https://youtu.be/GVsUOuSjvcg?t=221).
I also just wanted an excuse to learn how x86 does floating point.

## Build

- `make all`
